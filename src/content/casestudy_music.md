### **The Challenge: Overlooking Valuable Niche User Segments**

Our platform's primary focus was language learning. However, I observed a significant and growing user base for other subjects, particularly Music. While these were not core growth areas, they consistently ranked in our top 10 most popular subjects by hours purchased, representing a substantial, profitable revenue stream.

My concern was that these users faced unnecessary friction due to product limitations. For example:
*   **Lack of Specialization Filters:** Unlike languages (e.g. "Business English"), Music users couldn't search for "Guitar Tutor" or "Piano Tutor", forcing them to manually scroll through long lists and click into profiles.
*   **Inflexible Subscription Frequencies:** Many adult music learners preferred bi-weekly lessons due to practice time, but our subscription plans only offered weekly frequencies, pushing them towards less convenient options or even churn.

My hypothesis was that these overlooked user experience gaps were leading to unnecessary churn and hindering growth within these valuable niche segments.

### **My Role: Data-Driven Advocate**

This initiative fell outside my direct team's roadmap. My role was to act as a data-driven advocate for these users, identifying the problem, quantifying the opportunity and proposing simple solutions to improve their experience.

### **The Solution: Building a Case for Niche Improvements**

I approached this by building a clear, data-backed case:

1.  **Quantify the Opportunity:** I gathered data on the total hours and GMV generated by Music subject, demonstrating their substantial contribution to the company's bottom line, despite not being a primary growth focus.
2.  **Highlight User Friction:** I presented specific examples of user experience issues, backed by anecdotal feedback from customer support, illustrating how our generic platform was failing these specific users.
3.  **Propose Low-Effort Solutions:** I outlined simple backend changes (e.g. adding instrument specializations, allowing bi-weekly frequency options for specific subjects) that I believed could deliver high ROI by reducing friction and improving retention in these segments.

I presented this proposal to product leadership, emphasizing the potential for "easy wins" by serving an existing, valuable user base better.

### **The Outcome: Strategic Alignment and "Disagree and Commit"**

While the product leadership acknowledged the validity of my insights and the value of these user segments, they made a strategic decision to maintain laser-focus on core language growth. Resources were explicitly allocated away from non-core subjects to maximize impact in the primary business area.

The proposed features were not prioritized in the roadmap.

This project, while not resulting in a shipped feature, provided me with a crucial lesson in **"disagree and commit."** I learned that:
*   **Advocacy is Essential, but Strategy is King:** It's vital to advocate fiercely for what you believe is right, especially when backed by data.
*   **Respect Broader Strategic Alignment:** Once a strategic decision is made, even if you disagree with it, it's essential to understand the rationale and align your efforts with the broader company goals.
*   **Professional Conduct:** I documented my research and proposal in our internal knowledge base, ensuring the insights were preserved for future consideration. I then refocused my full energy on the prioritized roadmap items.

This experience reinforced the importance of strategic clarity and demonstrated my ability to contribute insights, influence discussions and ultimately commit professionally to the agreed-upon direction.
