A language-agnostic tool for managing `TODO` and `FIXME` comments across entire codebases, presented in full at PyCon Sweden 2014 and abridged at EuroPython 2014.

- **Architecture:** Built as a configurable pipeline, the tool finds tagged comments, enriches them with `git blame` metadata (author, date) and generates reports.
- **Purpose:** This early project was an exploration into building developer tooling and demonstrates an early interest in code quality and maintainability.
