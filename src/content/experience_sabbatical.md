An intentional period of professional development focused on deepening expertise in AI/LLM-driven engineering, system design and modern development workflows. Key activities include:

- **System Design:** Authored a comprehensive, production-level technical design for a [heuristic-based Spam Classification Engine](#system-design), demonstrating a pragmatic approach to building new features within legacy systems.
- **AI/LLM Application & Tooling:** Developed several open-source projects, including a [data pipeline using Python and LLMs](https://github.com/isaacbernat/basepaint-media) for a generative art archive and maintaining the popular [netflix-to-srt](https://github.com/isaacbernat/netflix-to-srt) tool (800+ stars).
- **Continued Learning:** Completed specialized courses on AI/LLM applications from DeepLearning.AI and Coursera to stay current with emerging technologies.

_A curated selection of **[GitHub Projects](#personal-open-source-projects)** from this period is detailed below._
