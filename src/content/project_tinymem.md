A Simon-inspired memory game for the Thumby, a keychain-sized programmable console.

- **Technology:** Written in under 50 lines of **MicroPython**, this project demonstrates resource-constrained development, making use of the device's audio, sprites and input buttons.
- **Purpose:** Served as a proof of concept for a complete, playable game with a tiny code footprint, and was the subject of a presentation at PyDayBCN 2023.
