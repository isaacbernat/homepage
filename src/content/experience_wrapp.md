Progressed from an early Backend Engineer to a key Fullstack Tech Lead during a major company pivot and technical transformation from a legacy Python 2.7 (Twisted) monolith to a modern Go/Python microservice architecture. I was also selected to speak at the inaugural **[PyCon Sweden 2014](https://github.com/isaacbernat/pycrastinate)**.

##### Fullstack Engineer & Tech Lead

_Sep 2014 – Jun 2016_

As a Tech Lead during the company's pivot to "Wrapp 2.0", I helped guide the technical transformation from a legacy Python 2.7/Twisted monolith to a modern Go/Python 3 microservice architecture.

- **DevOps & Tooling:** Architected and built "Opsweb," a mission-critical internal deployment system using Dart for managing canary releases of our 50+ microservices to AWS, complete with health checks and automated rollbacks.
- **Product Engineering:** Contributed to the "Wrappmin" merchant dashboard (React), focusing on the backend APIs for mapping credit card transactions to offers.
- **Microservice Ownership:** Created and maintained critical microservices in both Python (`users`) and Go (`offers`), coordinating with multiple contributors to ensure stability and performance.

##### Career Progression & Key Contributions

_Oct 2012 – Sep 2014_

As an early engineer in a fast-growing startup, I demonstrated high versatility by taking on roles across the stack to meet evolving business needs.

- **Data Engineering:** Enhanced and optimized the company's ETL pipeline for our Amazon Redshift data warehouse. Built real-time business and system KPI dashboards.
- **Frontend Engineering:** Owned and expanded the user-facing email service, leveraging an A/B testing framework to improve user engagement and deliver over 1M newsletters weekly.
- **Backend Foundations:** As one of the initial engineers, architected and implemented the company's first content recommendation engine from scratch.
