Progressed from an early, versatile engineer to a key Tech Lead during the company's critical "Wrapp 2.0" pivot, transforming the architecture from a legacy monolith to modern microservices. I was also selected to speak at the inaugural **[PyCon Sweden](https://github.com/isaacbernat/pycrastinate)**.

### Tech Lead & Founding Engineer (2.0 Pivot)

_Sep 2014 – Jun 2016_

As a Tech Lead for "Wrapp 2.0", I helped guide the technical transformation from a legacy Python 2.7/Twisted monolith to a modern Go/Python 3 microservice architecture.

- **DevOps & Tooling:** Architected and built "Opsweb," a mission-critical internal deployment system using Dart for managing canary releases of our 50+ microservices to AWS, complete with health checks and automated rollbacks.
- **Product Engineering:** Contributed to the "Wrappmin" merchant dashboard (React), focusing on the backend APIs for mapping credit card transactions to offers.
- **Microservice Ownership:** Created and maintained critical microservices in both Python (`users`) and Go (`offers`), coordinating with multiple contributors to ensure stability and performance.

### Early Engineer (Backend, Data, Frontend)

_Oct 2012 – Sep 2014_

As an early engineer in a fast-growing startup, I demonstrated high versatility by taking on roles across the stack to meet evolving business needs.

- **Engineered Core Systems from Scratch:** Built the company's first content recommendation engine and a comprehensive A/B testing email framework (delivering over 1M newsletters weekly).
- **Owned Redshift ETL Pipeline:** Architected and optimized the company's core data warehouse pipeline for business intelligence and built real-time KPI dashboards.
