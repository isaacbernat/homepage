Progressed from an early, versatile engineer to a key Tech Lead during the company's critical "Wrapp 2.0" pivot, transforming the architecture from a legacy monolith to modern microservices. I was also selected to speak at the inaugural **[PyCon Sweden](https://github.com/isaacbernat/pycrastinate)**.

### Tech Lead

_Sep 2014 – Jun 2016_

- **Microservice Architecture:** Helped guide the pivot from a Python 2.7/Twisted monolith to a distributed system of **50+ microservices** in Go and Python 3.
- **Core Service Ownership:** Maintained critical backend services: `users` (Python) and `offers` (Go). I was responsible for their architectural consistency and code quality. For core `offers` service this meant overseeing **1,200+ commits** from over 12 contributors.
- **Fintech Backend:** Built the core backend APIs for mapping credit card transactions to merchant offers, contributing to "Wrappmin" merchant dashboard.
- **Developer Tooling:** Designed and built "Opsweb", a mission-critical internal deployment system for managing canary releases. It directly improved developer velocity and site reliability with features like automated health checks and rollbacks.

### Early Engineer (Backend, Data, Frontend)

_Oct 2012 – Sep 2014_

- **Fraud Prevention:** Created a heuristic-based fraud prevention system to detect and block abuse of the platform’s gift card and coupon features, protecting the company and its customers from financial loss.
- **Data Engineering & Visualization:** Architected and optimized the high-volume ETL pipeline for our Redshift data warehouse and built real-time KPI dashboards for business and system monitoring.
- **Complex Frontend Engineering:** Evolved a comprehensive A/B testing email framework that delivered over **1M personalized newsletters weekly**. This involved complex rendering optimizations and extensive cross-client compatibility testing to ensure a consistent user experience.
- **Remote Collaboration:** Contributed effectively in an asynchronous, multi-time-zone environment with engineering teams in both Stockholm and San Francisco.
