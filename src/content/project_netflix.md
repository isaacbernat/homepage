This popular open-source tool (`800+` stars) provides a robust solution for converting Netflix subtitle files into the standard SRT format. It was created to solve a personal need that the community also shared, demonstrating the ability to identify a gap and build a widely adopted tool.

- **Dual Interface:** Offers both a powerful **Python CLI** for batch processing and automation and a user-friendly, client-side **JavaScript web interface** for single-file conversions.
- **Community Driven:** The project has grown to include multiple methods for acquiring subtitle files, timestamp shifting capabilities and has received contributions from the community.
