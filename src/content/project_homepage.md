This portfolio site itself is a testament to my engineering philosophy. It's a static site built without a heavy framework, using a custom Node.js script for a fully controlled and transparent build process.

- **Architecture:** Employs a "headless" approach, with all narrative content authored in Markdown for easy maintenance. The build process features parallelized tasks and per-page CSS loading to keep the homepage's render path exceptionally fast.
- **Discipline:** The entire Git history follows the **Conventional Commits** specification, ensuring a clean, readable and automated changelog.
- **Quality:** Focuses on performance, accessibility (WCAG compliant) and maintainability, as detailed in the project's README.
