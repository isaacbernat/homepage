### 1. Project rationale and impact
This project was for an online marketplace where students purchased trial lessons before committing to a tutor. The business model was based on selling prepaid packages of hours (6, 12, 20), which led to unpredictable revenue streams and significant friction each time users had to manually renew. Our proposal, "Subscribe to a Tutor," aimed to solve this by introducing auto-renewing subscriptions.

#### What data (if any) indicated it was worth pursuing?
The core hypothesis was primarily qualitative, informed by successful subscription-based precedents in other industries. We believed company goals aligned with user needs: predictable, recurring lessons help students achieve their learning goals, while tutors benefit from stable income and schedules.

Because this was a fundamental shift to the company's financial model, our existing data sources were insufficient for accurate forecasting. Therefore, our strategy was to launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within a controlled A/B test. This would allow a fair, data-driven comparison against the existing package model under identical market conditions.
