##### Senior Backend Engineer I (P7, Staff-Equivalent)
*Jun 2022 – Jul 2024*

- **Business Impact:** Drove the "Postpone Billing" experiment, **the single most profitable initiative of 2023** (out of 215 A/B tests), delivering a **+3% global Gross Margin lift**. Championed the project for three quarters against initial resistance, turning short-term negative metrics into a massive long-term win. ([Read the Case Study](#casestudy-postpone-billing))
- **Strategic Foresight:** Identified critical risks in a major company initiative ("Subs Direct") and formally advocated for a phased, iterative approach to mitigate over **10k+ hours in potential wasted development**. The core of my proposed strategy was eventually adopted after the initial "big bang" approach proved too complex.
- **Cross-Functional Leadership:** As the engineering representative for the Subscription Experience team I held bi-weekly stakeholder meetings with Finance, Data and CRM teams to coordinate on critical projects, ensuring data models and financial reporting remained accurate during high-stakes experiments. I also supported engineering-wide quality by conducting technical interviews for multiple backend roles.
- **Proactive System Ownership:** Identified and led the mitigation of critical bugs **outside my team's domain**, including a flaw costing over **$21k USD/week** and a celery task spamming the queue with over **1 million executions per hour**.

##### Backend Engineer III (P6, Senior)
*Mar 2020 – Jun 2022*

- **Founding the Subscription Model:** As the sole backend architect on the MVP, took on a high-risk challenge and led the transition from a package-only model to subscriptions. This foundational work grew to process over **200k+ monthly renewals** and was instrumental in securing a **Series C funding round**. ([Read the Full Case Study](#casestudy-subscription-model))
- **Incident Command & Observability:** Commanded and documented 15+ production incidents, including a **SEV-2 that went undetected for 16 hours** and led to a new, mandatory pre-launch monitoring policy for all high-risk features company-wide. ([Read the Incident Retrospective](#casestudy-incident-74))
- **Team Scaling & Mentorship:** After the MVP's success, helped build the dedicated Subscriptions team by interviewing 13 candidates and hiring 2 foundational engineers. Improved team agility by facilitating sprint retrospectives, cutting meeting time by 50% while increasing engagement.
- **Modernization & Performance:** Led the backend migration of the high-traffic (1M+ MAU) Q&A application from Django templates to a GraphQL API. This initiative drastically improved performance (e.g. **page load time reduced by ~85%** and Googlebot crawl rate increased by 8x) and unblocked a series of A/B tests that resulted in a **+300% lift in New Paying Customers** from the blog and an **+800% CVR increase** on the Q&A user flow.
