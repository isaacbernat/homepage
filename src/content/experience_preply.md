### Staff Backend Engineer

_Jun 2022 – Jul 2024_

As a Staff Engineer, I operated beyond my immediate team to shape the technical roadmap and lead complex, cross-functional initiatives. My role was to tackle the most ambiguous and impactful business problems, translating them into robust technical strategy and driving them to completion, directly influencing the company's bottom line and engineering standards.

- **Architectural & Product Leadership:** Led the company's #1 most impactful initiative of 2023 (out of 215 A/B tests), delivering a **+3% global Gross Margin lift**. I owned the project from strategy to execution, transforming an ambiguous business problem into a concrete technical roadmap and redesigning the core subscription monetization logic.

- **Proactive System Ownership:** I consistently identified and led the mitigation of critical production issues outside my team's direct domain. This included designing a rate-limiting solution to shut down a financial exploit that leveraged payment processing thresholds, fixing a promotions bug that was costing over **\$21k USD/week** and resolving a runaway Celery task that was executing over **1 million times per hour**.
- **Strategic Foresight:** Identified critical risks in a major company initiative ("Subs Direct") and formally advocated for a phased, iterative approach to mitigate over **10k+ hours in potential wasted development**. The core of my proposed strategy was eventually adopted after the initial "big bang" approach proved too complex.
- **Cross-Functional Leadership:** As the engineering DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) for my team's initiatives, I owned the communication and alignment with stakeholders across Finance, Data, Payments and CRM. A key part of my role was ensuring data models and financial reporting remained accurate during high-stakes experiments. I also supported engineering-wide quality by conducting technical interviews for multiple backend roles.

### Senior Backend Engineer

_Mar 2020 – Jun 2022_

As the founding backend architect for the Subscription MVP, I led the technical transition from a package-only model to a recurring revenue system that became the company's primary growth engine.

- **Founding the Subscription Platform:** As the founding backend architect for the Subscription MVP, I designed the core services and orchestrated the cross-team integrations (Payments, CRM, Data) for a secure and reliable recurring revenue system. This platform work soon grew to process over **200k+ monthly renewals**, was instrumental in securing a **Series C funding round**, delivered a **+41% YoY increase in LTV** and improved the **LTV-to-CAC ratio from 1.4x to 3.0x**.

- **Incident Leadership & Observability:** Commanded and documented over 15 production incidents. I used the blameless post-mortem from a critical SEV-2 that I caused to champion and establish a new, mandatory pre-launch monitoring policy for all high-risk features company-wide, turning a personal mistake into a systemic improvement. ([Read the Incident Retrospective](#casestudy-incident-74))
- **Team Scaling & Process Improvement:** Played a key role in scaling the dedicated Subscriptions team by interviewing 13 candidates and hiring 2 of its foundational engineers. I also redesigned our sprint retrospective process, which cut meeting time by 50% while increasing actionable outcomes and team engagement.
- **Modernization & Performance:** Led the backend migration of the high-traffic (1M+ MAU) Q&A application from Django templates to a GraphQL API. This initiative drastically improved performance (e.g. **page load time reduced by ~85%** and Googlebot crawl rate increased by 8x) and unblocked a series of A/B tests that resulted in a **+300% lift in New Paying Customers** from the blog and an **+800% CVR increase** on the Q&A user flow.
