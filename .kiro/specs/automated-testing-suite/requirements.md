# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a comprehensive automated testing suite for the personal homepage project to ensure code quality, accessibility compliance, and performance standards. The testing suite will integrate into the existing CI/CD pipeline to prevent regressions and maintain the high-quality standards established in the project.

The testing suite addresses a critical gap identified in the technical roadmap, moving from claiming quality to programmatically proving and enforcing it through automation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the homepage, I want automated accessibility testing so that I can ensure WCAG compliance is maintained across all changes without manual verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CI pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL execute accessibility tests using axe-core against the built HTML files
2. WHEN accessibility violations are detected THEN the system SHALL fail the build and provide detailed violation reports
3. WHEN testing both light and dark themes THEN the system SHALL verify WCAG 2.0 AA compliance for both color schemes
4. WHEN all accessibility tests pass THEN the system SHALL allow the build to proceed to deployment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the homepage, I want automated performance testing so that I can prevent performance regressions and maintain optimal site speed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CI pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL execute Lighthouse audits against the built site
2. WHEN performance scores drop below defined thresholds THEN the system SHALL fail the build with detailed performance reports
3. WHEN performance budgets are exceeded THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations for optimization
4. IF performance scores meet or exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL allow deployment to proceed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the homepage, I want unit tests for the build script so that I can ensure the asset pipeline works correctly and catch build-related bugs early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build script tests run THEN the system SHALL verify that all expected files are generated in the dist directory
2. WHEN testing asset minification THEN the system SHALL verify that CSS, JS, and HTML files are properly minified
3. WHEN testing sitemap generation THEN the system SHALL verify that the sitemap.xml file is updated with current dates
4. WHEN testing favicon processing THEN the system SHALL verify that both SVG and ICO favicons are generated correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the homepage, I want visual regression testing so that I can detect unintended UI changes and maintain visual consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visual regression tests run THEN the system SHALL capture screenshots of key pages in both light and dark themes
2. WHEN comparing against baseline images THEN the system SHALL detect pixel-level differences and flag significant changes
3. WHEN visual differences are detected THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side comparison images for review
4. IF no visual regressions are detected THEN the system SHALL allow the build to proceed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the homepage, I want the testing suite integrated into the CI/CD pipeline so that all tests run automatically on every commit without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically run all test suites before deployment
2. WHEN any test fails THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and provide clear failure reports
3. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL proceed with the existing deployment workflow
4. WHEN tests are running THEN the system SHALL provide clear progress indicators and logging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the homepage, I want configurable test thresholds so that I can adjust quality standards as the project evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring performance budgets THEN the system SHALL allow setting minimum scores for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO
2. WHEN configuring accessibility tests THEN the system SHALL allow specifying which WCAG levels to enforce (A, AA, AAA)
3. WHEN configuring visual regression tests THEN the system SHALL allow setting pixel difference thresholds for acceptable changes
4. IF configuration files are updated THEN the system SHALL use the new thresholds in subsequent test runs
